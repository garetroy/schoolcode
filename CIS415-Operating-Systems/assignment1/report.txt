Everything in my implementation works except for leak free. For some reason when using free's it gives seg fault. But other wise all is tested and works well. 

On my hashmap my size was resized by double its size.

During this project (as you will see in my source code) my solutions come from a mixture of myself, Chris Brooks, Howard Lin, and Jack Brockway. No copied code, but disscussed our implementation openly. (only for mlist.c)
