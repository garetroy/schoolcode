\chapter*{Optimization Plan}

My optimizaion plan is as follows (and will be summarized on the following page).

I first plan to optimize my functions and matrix class initially, as these are the utilities that are utilized the most. 

After that I plan to work on parallelizing the camera and triangle classes. This will take some time because there are a lot of optimizaions that could be made in triangle. 

Lastly I will take on the two harder ones, which would be main and screen. They both have the most and hardest for loops to make parallel.
