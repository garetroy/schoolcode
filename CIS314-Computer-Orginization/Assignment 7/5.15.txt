B)

(4+3)/3 = 2.33
(4 for floating multiplication)
(3 for floating addition)
(divide by clock cycle)

C)
(3+1)/3 = 1.33
(3 for multiplication)
(1 for addition)
(divide by clock cycle)

D)
mulss could cause a hazard if there wasn't a delay in cycles and would cause some sort of error if there wasn't 4 or 5 clock cycles.
