Assumingly as we increase the size of the images, the times that it takes for the filter functions to exectute will increase. From the output of logger, it seems that the time grows for execution time almost exponentially. This makes sense because there are more pixels for it to perform operations on. With the fastest time was 0.007880s for the first color to execute verus the slowest is 0.552860s for the 2000x2000 constant color.
